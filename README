Following my wedding, my wife and I recieved almost 3,000 photos broken out in almost 60 different zip files. 

Not only was this a huge storage grab, it was an extremely mundane and tedious task if we were to extract 
each one individually and then sort them to the correct folder.

The script in this folder iterated through all of the zip file names and extracted the photos to the correct folder. 


To give you an insight into ALL of the zip files I was given, they are listed below. 
The script goes through and creates a folder for "Ceremony", "Reception", etc... and puts the photos in the correct folder
